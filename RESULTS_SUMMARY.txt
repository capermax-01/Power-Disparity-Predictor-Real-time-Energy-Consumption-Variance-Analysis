## 💡 INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### What is Power Disparity?
**Power Disparity** measures the variability/unpredictability of power consumption.

- **Formula**: Coefficient of Variation (CV) = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100%

### Disparity Levels
- **CV > 100%**: HIGH - Very unpredictable, hard to manage
- **CV 50-100%**: MEDIUM - Moderate variability, needs planning
- **CV < 50%**: LOW - Predictable, good for baseline planning
- **CV ≈ 0%**: STABLE - Constant consumption, ideal for scheduling

### Why It Matters
1. **Grid Management**: Predicting variability improves load balancing
2. **Equipment Planning**: High-disparity devices need redundancy
3. **Cost Optimization**: Schedule flexible loads during low-disparity periods
4. **Maintenance**: Monitor high-disparity appliances for degradation
5. **Capacity Planning**: Design systems with variability in mind

## 📞 SUPPORT & QUESTIONS

### Common Questions Answered

**Q: Why is radiator_309 so unstable?**
A: Radiators have ON/OFF cycling patterns based on temperature, creating high variability (CV=125.51%)

**Q: Can I predict specific appliance failures?**
A: Not directly, but increasing disparity often indicates equipment degradation - monitor trend changes.

**Q: How often should I retrain the model?**
A: Monthly recommended, or when prediction accuracy drops >5%

**Q: Can this work with real-time data?**
A: Yes! Model is optimized for <50ms inference time.
